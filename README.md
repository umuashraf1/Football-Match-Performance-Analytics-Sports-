## **Project Overview**

The **Football Match Performance Analytics** project focuses on building an end-to-end analytics pipeline for football matches. It involves extracting live match and player data, processing the data to generate insights, storing it in a structured database, and visualizing the results in **Grafana**.

---

## **Data Source**

* **API Provider:** [API-Football](https://www.football-data.org))
* **Authentication:** Requires a free API key
* **Data Retrieved:**

  * Match fixtures & results
  * Player stats
  * League standings
  * Team performance data

---

## **Deliverables**

### **1. Python ETL Script**

* Fetches match and player statistics from **API-Football**.
* Cleans and transforms data.
* Calculates:

  * **Possession %**
  * **Pass accuracy**
  * **Player performance scores**.

### **2. PostgreSQL Schema**

Database designed to store football data efficiently.

**Tables:**

* **teams** â†’ team details
* **matches** â†’ match fixtures & results
* **players** â†’ player details
* **stats** â†’ performance metrics

### **3. Grafana Dashboard**

Three primary dashboards were created:

#### **a) League Standings**

Shows the latest positions, points, wins, draws, and losses.

---

#### **b) Player Performance Heatmaps**

Visualizes player performance scores based on position and activity.

---

#### **c) Match Outcome Predictions**

Displays probability-based match result predictions.

## **Implementation Workflow**

1. **Data Extraction** â†’ football-api.org API.
2. **Data Transformation** â†’ Python ETL pipeline.
3. **Data Storage** â†’ PostgreSQL database.
4. **Data Visualization** â†’ Grafana dashboards.

---

## **Challenges and Solutions**
1. API Limitations

Issue: The initial API (API-Football) restricted access to detailed player stats due to free subscription limits.

Solution: Switched to football-data.org, which provided wider coverage for matches, players, and standings.

2. Data Transformation Complexity

Issue: Calculating possession %, pass accuracy, and performance scores required aggregating multiple datasets.

Solution: Built custom Python functions to clean, normalize, and merge datasets for accurate analysis.

3. Grafana Integration

Issue: Grafana works best with real-time or structured data, while our API data was fetched in batches.

Solution: Created optimized PostgreSQL views and queries to simulate real-time match stats for smooth dashboard visualization.

4. Team Collaboration

Issue: Out of the entire group, only three members actively contributed to the project.

Solution: Maintained smooth collaboration through Discord and we also introduced Whatsapp group call and chat.

Lessons Learned

API Selection Matters â€“ Free APIs often have data limitations; switching to a better API early saves time.

Data Transformation is Crucial â€“ Clean, structured data leads to better insights and smoother dashboards.

Grafana Needs Optimized Data â€“ Pre-aggregating stats in PostgreSQL makes dashboards load faster and look cleaner.

Collaboration is Key â€“ Clear role assignments improved efficiency and avoided duplication of tasks.

## **Next Steps**

* Automate ETL jobs using **Airflow** .
